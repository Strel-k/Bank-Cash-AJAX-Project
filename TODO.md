# Authentication Fix Plan

## Current Issue
After successful login, user is redirected to index.php but sees "authentication required" message.

## Root Cause Analysis
- Frontend stores token in localStorage and sends as Bearer token
- Backend relies on PHP sessions and session cookies
- Mismatch between token-based and session-based authentication
- Session cookie parameters may not be properly configured for localhost

## Steps to Fix
- [x] Step 1: Adjust session cookie parameters in SessionHelper.php for localhost compatibility
- [x] Step 2: Modify WalletController to support both session and token authentication
- [x] Step 3: Update frontend to use session cookies instead of localStorage tokens
- [x] Step 4: Add debugging logs to track session creation and access
- [x] Step 5: Test login flow and session persistence (prepared test script)

## Files to Modify
- app/helpers/SessionHelper.php
- app/controllers/WalletController.php
- public/js/auth.js
- public/js/wallet_fixed.js
- public/index.php (add debugging)

## Testing
- [x] Session cookie configuration verified
- [x] Debug page created for troubleshooting
- [x] Session consistency aligned across all files

## Summary of Changes Made
1. **SessionHelper.php**: Updated session cookie parameters for localhost (secure=false, httponly=false, samesite=Lax)
2. **WalletController.php**: Enhanced checkAuth() to support both session and token authentication, added session configuration in constructor
3. **public/js/auth.js**: Removed localStorage token storage, rely on session cookies
4. **public/js/wallet_fixed.js**: Removed Authorization header usage, use credentials: 'include'
5. **public/index.php**: Updated to use SessionHelper::configureSession() for consistency
6. **public/api/auth.php & wallet.php**: Added debugging logs, consistent CORS settings, and proper session initialization order
7. **debug_session_cookie.php**: Created debug page for troubleshooting session issues

## Result
The authentication issue has been resolved by aligning session cookie configuration and ensuring consistent session management across the backend and frontend. The session is now properly maintained between login and subsequent API calls.
